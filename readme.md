# Project #2: A Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application** from scratch. You'll be **building a Sinatra app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we'll give you the tools over the next week to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have one model** (you can add more if it makes sense, but this should be done **after** you have an app with one model fully functioning) – your one model can be anything but a `user`, as we will not cover authentification until we get to Rails.

* **Have complete RESTful routes** for your resource (model) with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

* **Use ActiveRecord or Mongoid (SQL or Mongo) to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data.

* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process.

* **Follow user stories** that are written on Trello in a conventional way.

* Have **semantically clean HTML, ERB and CSS**.

* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

Your app may:

* **Use AJAX** either to make a request to your own backend to CRUD data without a page reload **OR** to hit an external API. Or both!

* **Have more than one model** that have a relationship to one another.

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publically-accessible **user stories you created**

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Go one step at a time.** Test your assumptions every step of the way.

* **Ask for help.** In the next couple of projects we will expect you to be more independent. In this one, we want to give you all of the support we can. At minimum, your consultants may respond with "Google ____ and then come back." That is perfectly fine, and might help!

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need.

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems.** What we mean by this is create a new file and write some code **outside** of your app to test things out without worry of breaking something you already did.

* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer

* **Commit early, commit often.** Use branches! Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what ot build

* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps. This goes especially for the `business logic` of your app. For example in the first potential idea below, the business logic refers to the construction of the Haiku.

### Weekend Preparation

Over the weekend, figure out what kind of app you would like to create, and begin your planning process.  Be prepared to present your plan to your consultants and your fellow developers.  Create a repo for your project, and send a link to your consultants.  We will be expecting all of the following to be included in that repo's README by Monday.

1. A brief description of your app's idea.  Be sure to include front-end and back-end details.
2. A link to a Trello board with at least 5 relevant user stories.
3. At least one image showing the design of your app (e.g. wireframe, whiteboard, napkin drawing).
4. A description of at least 4 routes: 1 each of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Potential Project Ideas

#### Haiku Generator
- Make an app to generate Haiku's on a given topic.
- A user enters a word like "summer" or "programming" into a form, which creates a new "Haiku" and saves in the database.
- A user can also see all of the Haikus by going to the index page. They can also delete them or edit them.
- How would the logic of generating a haiku work? That's up to you. I would start by not worrying if they make any sense at all and just getting the syllable count right

#### Cheerful Messages

- Create an app that will allow people to create "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters.
- Cheerups can be upvoted, downvoted or reported as spam!
- If they get more than one spam report they are deleted.
- If they get more than x downvotes, users can edit them!
- Alternatively, make "Bumouts"


#### Can You Eat It?
- The app that asks, "Can you eat it?"
- Users can enter a word or words into a form, and find out if they can eat it!
- When a form is submitted the logic for determining edibility is run, and the query is saved in the database with a boolean for edibility.  
- Alternatives could be "Can it Fly", "Does it Exist?", or whatever you can dream of. Think about using external API's like Wikipedia for finding answers.

#### A Personal Dashboard
- Build something useful for yourself!
- You must CRUD something. What is helpful to you? Basketball scores? Projects? Surf height? Best thing's you've eaten in the Bay Area?
- Can you use AJAX to get and display the weather from an external API? Or to get your schedule for the day?

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
